# Tools Usage Rules

## Code Development Workflow

Follow this systematic approach for all code development tasks:

### 1. Before Writing/Editing Code
**Use zen to analyze, get consensus, and plan:**
- Analyze requirements and technical approach
- Get multi-model consensus on implementation strategy
- Create detailed implementation plans
- Identify potential issues and alternatives

### 2. Code Implementation
**Prefer to use aider for writing/editing code:**
- Use aider for all code creation and modification tasks
- Follow the established plans from zen analysis
- Implement systematically according to consensus recommendations
- Remember to use proper file paths (ex_llm/ prefix)

### 3. After Code is Written
**Use zen to review the code:**
- Analyze the implemented code for quality and correctness
- Validate against original requirements and plans
- Identify any issues or improvements needed
- Ensure code follows best practices and patterns

## Workflow Summary

```
Requirements → zen (analyze/consensus/plan) → aider (implement) → zen (review)
```

## Benefits

- **Quality Assurance**: Multiple validation points ensure high-quality code
- **Expert Consensus**: Leverage multiple AI models for better decisions
- **Systematic Approach**: Structured workflow reduces errors and oversights
- **Continuous Improvement**: Post-implementation review catches issues early
