# Gemini API: Models

The models endpoint provides a way for you to programmatically list the available models, and retrieve extended metadata such as supported functionality and context window sizing. Read more in the Models guide.

## Method: models.get

Gets information about a specific Model such as its version number, token limits, parameters and other metadata. Refer to the Gemini models guide for detailed model information.

### Endpoint

`get https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/{name=models/*}`

### Path parameters

  * **name** (string): Required. The resource name of the model. This name should match a model name returned by the `models.list` method. Format: `models/{model}`

### Request body

The request body must be empty.

### Example request

```shell
curl https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash?key=$GEMINI_API_KEY
```

### Response body

If successful, the response body contains an instance of `Model`.

## Method: models.list

Lists the Models available through the Gemini API.

### Endpoint

`get https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models`

### Query parameters

  * **pageSize** (integer): The maximum number of Models to return (per page). If unspecified, 50 models will be returned per page. This method returns at most 1000 models per page, even if you pass a larger pageSize.
  * **pageToken** (string): A page token, received from a previous `models.list` call. Provide the `pageToken` returned by one request as an argument to the next request to retrieve the next page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to `models.list` must match the call that provided the page token.

### Request body

The request body must be empty.

### Example request

```shell
curl https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models?key=$GEMINI_API_KEY
```

### Response body

Response from `ListModel` containing a paginated list of Models. If successful, the response body contains data with the following structure:

  * **models[]** (object (Model)): The returned Models.
  * **nextPageToken** (string): A token, which can be sent as `pageToken` to retrieve the next page. If this field is omitted, there are no more pages.

<!-- end list -->

```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      object (Model)
    }
  ],
  "nextPageToken": string
}
```

## REST Resource: models

### Resource: Model

Information about a Generative Language Model.

  * **name** (string): Required. The resource name of the Model. Refer to Model variants for all allowed values. Format: `models/{model}` with a `{model}` naming convention of: `"{baseModelId}-{version}"`. Examples: `models/gemini-1.5-flash-001`
  * **baseModelId** (string): Required. The name of the base model, pass this to the generation request. Examples: `gemini-1.5-flash`
  * **version** (string): Required. The version number of the model. This represents the major version (1.0 or 1.5).
  * **displayName** (string): The human-readable name of the model. E.g. "Gemini 1.5 Flash". The name can be up to 128 characters long and can consist of any UTF-8 characters.
  * **description** (string): A short description of the model.
  * **inputTokenLimit** (integer): Maximum number of input tokens allowed for this model.
  * **outputTokenLimit** (integer): Maximum number of output tokens available for this model.
  * **supportedGenerationMethods[]** (string): The model's supported generation methods. The corresponding API method names are defined as Pascal case strings, such as `generateMessage` and `generateContent`.
  * **temperature** (number): Controls the randomness of the output. Values can range over `[0.0,maxTemperature]`, inclusive. A higher value will produce responses that are more varied, while a value closer to `0.0` will typically result in less surprising responses from the model. This value specifies default to be used by the backend while making the call to the model.
  * **maxTemperature** (number): The maximum temperature this model can use.
  * **topP** (number): For Nucleus sampling. Nucleus sampling considers the smallest set of tokens whose probability sum is at least `topP`. This value specifies default to be used by the backend while making the call to the model.
  * **topK** (integer): For Top-k sampling. Top-k sampling considers the set of `topK` most probable tokens. This value specifies default to be used by the backend while making the call to the model. If empty, indicates the model doesn't use top-k sampling, and `topK` isn't allowed as a generation parameter.
